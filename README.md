## INFO
There are many things that are not finished yet, here is the list of unfinished mechanics.
> 1. Shop, it doesn't work for now.
> 2. Bulk roll system.
> 3. Sell system, i made it, but deleted for now because it's broken, i need to think about how i will realise it.
> 4. Rolling system, it's not finished, and bugged, because when you start holding R to roll, it first waits roll_cooldown, and only then it triggers roll function, will fix it soon.
